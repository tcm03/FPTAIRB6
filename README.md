# FSOFT AI Residency Program Batch 6

My name is **Từ Cảnh Minh**. I'm currently a fourth-year student at **Ho Chi Minh University of Science, Vietnam National University**, majoring in **Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence**.

This repository contains my implementation for the short **MMLU challenge** by FPT Software, which is one of the entrance test for the Residency program. During **3 days**, my work progress is as follows:
- Experiment with [CodeQwen-1.5-7B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/CodeQwen1.5-7B) with zero-shot prompting strategy.
- Experiment with [Qwen2.5-Coder-7B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-7B) with one-shot prompting strategy.
- Experiment with [Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct) with one-shot prompting strategy.
- Experiment with [Qwen2.5-Coder-14B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-14B) with zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies.
- Experiment with [Qwen2.5-Coder-14B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-14B-Instruct) with one-shot and few-shot prompting strategies.

**Future work** includes:
- Fine-tuning 7B or 14B models using parameter-efficient finetuning techniques: prompt tuning, LoRA.
- Ensemble predictions of various models and do a majority vote.
